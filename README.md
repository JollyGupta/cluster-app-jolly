Mall Customer Segmentation & Prediction App
Built an end-to-end ML solution for mall customer analysis. Used KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering for segmentation, 
evaluated with Silhouette Score, Adjusted Rand Score, and Mutual Information Score. 
Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer segments and applied regression models to estimate spending scores. 
Saved models as .pkl files. Developed three Streamlit apps (1 classification, 2 regression) and deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

App Development & Deployment: anaconda command prompt, streamlit, streamlit-cloud

Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sweetviz, ydata-profiling, yellowbrick scikit-learn, joblib
